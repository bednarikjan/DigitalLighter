We started the meeting with the discussion about the reworked Work Break Down structure. The superviser briefly revised the WBS and approved of it. If we add the new classes while implementing we should visualize just these new classes in the relevant Sprint section. We are required to do create the overal time estimation table for the whole project. We should als add the section describing our effort regarding image processing pre-study in Sprint 3. The Test plan section should be moved to the Planning section and we should reduce the number of chapters in general (it is reasinable to have around 15 chapters alltogether).
