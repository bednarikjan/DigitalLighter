- summary what happend in two weaks
- project plan 
    in project scope mention scaling
    mention features what we must deliver, what is compulsory, agree with customer (requirement part)
    clear description of project, requirement and design should be in separate section
    requirements in scope section
    project objective description before project scope (mark, product)
    project scope - talk about what is not in the scope, emphesise that
    project architecture -> product architecture -> move 
    final report ->
    keep minimum number of internal documents
    success -> effects
    general terms -> customer constrains
    two sections - basic requirements
                 - sprint requirements (in sprint sections)
    non-functional req - like how many users can this support
    evaluation
    testing plan - customer
                 - can decide if we decide testing plan before or after
    midterm report - part of the final report, same document
                   - 70% percent of report
    some fixed milestones (at least one)
    section terminology - explain term milestone, 
    course milestones - midterm report, 
    lifecycle for each sprint - chartt
    work breakdown structure - more like a plan, google image, detail work
                             - prototype, features of that prototype (epic, user stories, ...)
    QA -> rename team communication
    general terms methodology -> move it to different section

next weekend - write as much as possible to report
    - show prototype on next meeting
