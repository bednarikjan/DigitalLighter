We have started by showing the customer our live prototype and we have also sent him video on youtube with demonstration of working prototype. Customer was satisfied with the video and suggested recording our future prototypes. After that we started planning next sprint, we decided to focus on multiple client support and sprint 3 will be focused on image processing. Customer suggested that we should work on core modules from the beginning and refine them in future so we can catch problems in early phases.
