\nextItem Sprint 2 will focus on adding support for multiple clients connection and sending different signals to different clients. & We should revise and improve our code so that we can move on to another core part during the next sprint.
\nextItem We will choose user stories for sprint 2 on ourselves and then ask the customer for his approval. & We finished everything needed in Sprint 1 so we should be able to pick the right stories that suit our velocity.
\nextItem Sprint 3 will be focused on image processing. & We should move on to this another core part as soon as possible so that we would have enough time should we come across major difficulties.
