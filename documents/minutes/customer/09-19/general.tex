Since 2 member were missing we tried to make the meeting short. We went through the stories for sprint 2 and customer approved them. Then we dissucces limitation of Android platform (heap size) and talked about possible solutions like distributed server or remote server. After that we have talk about similar products and their advantages and disadvatages in comparison to our project. In case these product have dealth with simimlar issues like we will, we shall look up to their solutions. Customer also suggested using mobile phone not as a single pixel in big screen but as a part of the screen (4 quater of video in case of 4 phones).
