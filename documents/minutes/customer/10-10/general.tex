In the begening we presented our demo video to our customer and he was satisfied. 
Than we have talk about the future of product, and how the next demo should look like. 
We have agreed on "Trafic light" and "Moving device on colorful matrix" as a goal for sprint 4. 
Customer has revised our user stories and add a story  about collecting phones so we can use them for final demonstration. 
We have also suggested to prepare acceptance tests for him to approve.
