As in previous sprint chapters, work-flow trough sprint 5 will be described. What makes this sprint different from the others, is that the team had to manage occurred risk on communication module. A good part of this chapter will be devoted to resolution of risk, but it will not lack the rest of the processes such as planning, establishing goals and retrospective.


\section{Sprint planning}

The planning started with customer meeting at Thursday 24th of October 2013. For customer, main event and goal of this sprint is finalizing prototype and recording demo video. Therefore planning includes tasks as: collecting phones from friends, researching the companies that do mobile development and borrowing the phones from them, renting the room and recording equipment from university.

Team agreed that borrowing phones from companies should be backup plan since sufficient number of phones (at least 16) can be collected from friends and colleagues. 

Recording final demo is planned for Thursday 7th of November, and informing potential phone owners that will be able to share their phones with us is planned at least one week before the event. This way table of potential phones can be crated, and risk of not collecting the sufficient number of devices can be reduced and solved. 

Recording equipment is planned to be rented or reserved at least 3 days before the event.

\section{Sprint Goal}

On the end of this sprint team expect to have working, the prove of concept demo. As core modules are finished, team will invest time in tuning existing and implementing some of the supporting functionalities. Some of them are: speeding up the detection process  and preparing predefined gallery to be played. Goal for this sprint is also a time sync between server and clients. Reason is bypassing possible networking latency, and enabling clients to play the content more precise. 

\section{Duration}
This sprint is 2 weeks long. From 28th of October 2013 to 10th of November 2013. 
Team agreed on the date of presentation and showing the running demo â€“ on Thursday 7th of November 2013.
Estimated velocity is 200 hours since every team member will devote 25 working hours per week.

\section{Architecture}

At first team was thinking about implementing the clock synchronization from scratch. Using one of the popular algorithms as Berkeley algorithm\footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=\&arnumber=29484}, and adding additional responsibility to server or client application. 

The Barkley algorithm requires feedback communication from clients by implementing receiving message system on server. Calculating the time offset on server and adjusting local times on clients. The protocol will have to expended in order to support clock sync communication. Although this approach will work, lot of changes on existing architecture have to be done.

As focus of this project is on proving the concept, and time for big implementation parts or structure changes is not sufficient, team agreed on researching alternative solutions before start implementing. This is also part of Risk management strategy where team have to be careful not to implement things they are not suppose to \ref{tab:risks}. Further research have brought to Network Time Protocol(NTP)\footnote{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905\#section-14}.

Good thing about NTP is that it is used for variable-latency data networks. It was only needed to find application that provide NTP service, and change client code to call this service and determine what is a local time offset before connecting to Digital Lighter server application. In that case, change of existing architecture will be minimal, and it will play only on client application. No server, or protocol will have to be changed.

As solution Time Server\footnote{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icecoldapps.timeserver} application have been chosen. It will work on same device as Digital Lighter server application, and it will provide same time as Digital Lighter application would. Deployment digram is therefore changed, and now includes NTP server as artifact.

	\label{fig:sprint5_deployment_diagram}
\end{figure}

Change have influence on messages interchange between server and clients. The difference comparing to old sequence diagram is given at Figure \ref{fig:sprint5_sequence_diagram}. New calls are colored red. 

\begin{figure}[H]

		\includegraphics[width=9cm]{sprint5/communication}
	\caption{Sequence diagram}
	\label{fig:sprint5_sequence_diagram}
\end{figure}

Observing deployment and sequence diagrams, it is easy to see that this solution didn't need existing system to change. But in same time new functionality have been added and big amount of time have been saved. This way project architecture follows open/closed principle\footnote{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc546578.aspx}. System is closed for changes, but open for extensions.



Logical view of added module is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Time_Sync_class }. Class \texttt{SNTPClient} makes call to time server in separate thread, and in \texttt{doInBackground} method retrieve NtpMessage object in order extract exact time from server. \texttt{NtpMessage} represents a NTP message, as specified in RFC 2030\footnote{http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-2030.txt}. The message format is compatible with all versions of NTP and SNTP. This class does not support the optional authentication protocol, and ignores the key ID and message digest fields. For convenience, this class exposes message values as native Java types, not the NTP-specified data formats. For example, timestamps are stored as doubles (as opposed to the NTP unsigned 64-bit fixed point format). However, the contructor NtpMessage(byte[]) and the method toByteArray() allow the import and export of the raw NTP message format.

\section{Testing}
\section{Occurring risks}
First time during development process, team have encountered the risk that might influence successful finish of the project. 
Restarting of client devices during runtime is noted. This issue didn't happen very often in the past, and source of it have been attached to not very stable Android device in team possession. Team were unable to replicate this error on other devices, and recklessly marked it as a isolated case. As number of testing devices become bigger multiple phones started to behave the same and it was obvious that it is not isolated problem. 

Researching Internet for similar problems lead to the
reason of client restarting - race condition inside \texttt{NsdManager} class. The issue is registered on the Android issues list\footnote{https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=35585} and has been fixed on Oct 18. 2013. Release is planned for Android 4.4 so only changing Android NSD for some of the previous technologies can solve the problem. 

At that time, working on next core module (image processing), with knowledge that issue will be gone with next release of Android system, was preferable by the customer. For that reason team exchanged few e-mails with the customer explaining that previous decision to stick to Android NSD have multiple bad effects on the recording of final prototype:
\begin{itemize}
\item Team will be in possession of big number of Android devices for a limited period of time. If clients restart in middle of the presentation that will take away notably amounts of time.

\item NSD works just on devices powered by Jelly Bean(4.1.x) or KitKat(4.4). Most of the phones team have plan to borrow are not brand new and do not support Android NSD service.
\end{itemize}

Finally the customer agreed on adding another user story with high priority - Replace NSD communication module with one of the technologies previously researched.

\section{Customer feedback}
\section{Retrospective}
This section reflects on the past sprint. In order to learn from the mistakes done and thus to improve the workflow it is necessary to answer two essential questions: "What went well" and "What could be improved".
