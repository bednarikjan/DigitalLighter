This is on ofthe final phases of this project, the evaluation. 
In this chapter, we will evaluate different aspects of the projects. 
Here it will be discussed why and how the outcome ended up being what it is today.
We have chosen to split the evaluation into three major parts, group evaluation, project evaluation and technology evaluation. 
 
It will start with an evaluation of the planning phase and our preliminary studies.  
Then we will look at our use of the scrum method, and how we had to modify it for our project, before moving on to a discussion of our conduction of meetings. 
The technology evaluation will be a fairly straightforward discussion and evaluation of our experiences with the technology we used in this project.

\section{Group evaluation}
The group evaluation will discuss the social aspects of the project. 
We will discuss the team dynamics, our goals, how we used our role assignment, risk assessment, the advisor the customer, and other issues regarding group evaluation in general.
The project evaluation will be a discussion of the work process and technical problems we encountered.

\subsection{Team dynamics}

\subsection{Communication}
The communication was done through frequent physical meetings, and if someone had other obligations and they were not able to be precent, then we kept in contact though Facebook. This was a suitable solution for us since the team members were available online nearly all the time. 
This made coordination an easier task, since other members could be consulted at any time. 
Furthermore, our small group size allowed us to get well known with each other.

\subsubsection{Effort and estimation}
Throughout the project, time restrictions has been an issue for the group. Most of the 
members in the group have had other group projects during the semester, making it hard to
