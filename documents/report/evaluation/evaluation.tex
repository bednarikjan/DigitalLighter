The evaluation is one of the final phases of this project. In this chapter, we will evaluate different aspects of the projects. 
Here it will be discussed why and how the outcome ended up being what it is today.
This includes how the team worked together, why it gave the result it did, the cooperation with the customer, and how it was working with an overseeing force. Furthermore,we will discuss the issues met during the project, and how the process we used worked for us.
We have chosen to split the evaluation into three major parts, group evaluation, project evaluation and technology evaluation. 
 
 
This is the final phase of this project, the evaluation. Here it will be discussed why and how the outcome
ended up being what it is today.  
The technology evaluation will be a fairly straightforward discussion and evaluation of our experiences with the technology we used in this project.

\section{Group evaluation}
The group evaluation will discuss the social aspects of the project. 
We will discuss the team dynamics, our goals, how we used our role assignment, risk assessment, the advisor the customer, and other issues regarding group evaluation in general.
The project evaluation will be a discussion of the work process and technical problems we encountered.

\subsection{Team dynamics}

\subsection{Communication}
The communication was done through frequent physical meetings, and if someone had other obligations and they were not able to be precent, then we kept in contact though Facebook. This was a suitable solution for us since the team members were available online nearly all the time. 
This made coordination an easier task, since other members could be consulted at any time. 
Furthermore, our small group size allowed us to get well known with each other, and this made the communication better.

Key words for further writing

working hours and people not showing up in time cuz they did something late at night and then figures it was okay not to show up, then the rest of the group did not show up either.


+pysical meetings
+facebook
+stand ups, could have done more of those
+meetings, did not have weekently, but we asked for them if we neededto

-Not alwas CC in emails to the whole group
-Some members did not get the information when needed 


write something about conflicts resolution?

All in all there wherent personal issues, friends, just discussions regaring solutions to the project.

\subsection{Work distribution}

The work distribution was very dynamic. We agreed on what needed to be done, and then group members had to take individual responsibility to perform work on the tasks they were comfortable with.
We could have distributed the work more evenly through out the project. 
It was a little stessful towars the ending of the project. Especially since we had to prioritize making the demo-video in the 5th sprint. Then we had a little trouble with the demo-video, and we had to spend more hours than we first thought. Because of this writing the documentation was a lower priority, and we fell a little behind.  
  

\subsubsection{Effort and estimation}
Throughout the project, time restrictions has been an issue for the group. Most of the 
members in the group have had other group projects during the semester, making it hard to

\section{Project Evaluation}
This section will start with an evaluation of the planning phase and our preliminary studies.  
Then we will look at our use of the scrum method, and how we had to modify it for our project, before moving on to a discussion of our conduction of meetings.
