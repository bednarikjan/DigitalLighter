\section{Sprint planning}
It was formerly intended to devote the last sprint to the tasks related with finishing and refining the report as well as preparing the final presentation and rehearsing. Nevertheless as the application performance issues occurring during the last sprint prevented the team from accomplishing to record the final demonstration video part of the total sum of person-hours available in this sprint must be spent on creating the video again.

The planning of this sprint started already during the last customer meeting held on 7th November where he suggested to use different types of imagery to be displayed on borrowed phones (see Section \ref{txt:sprint5_customerfeedback}). 

- what to create
- collect phones again
- collect the recording device
- process the video
- other already planned stuff
- deploy the app

Due to the fact the final version of the project must be submitted on the fixed date this sprint is shorter by two work days and the workload must be adjusted accordingly. The team has eight work days to its disposal which makes it for 140 person-hours for the whole team.
