\section{Sprint planning}
We have embraced Sprint 0 as a preliminary sprint, when we can set up all necessary collaboration tools, equipment, prepare templates for meetings and mainly to acquaint ourselves with Scrum methodology. The original plan was to finish sprint 0 on 8th of September, but we have decided to terminate it prematurely due to finishing sprint goals in shorter time than we had expected. Other reason for terminating the sprint was desire to start actually working on the product itself.

The actual user stories are listed in table \ref{tab:sprint0stories}. Since we started to use the software collaboration tool only during the sprint we did not manage to estimate the time needed to complete each story beforehand and thus the column \textbf{Est.} is left empty.

\section{System Burndown}
Since we managed to establish the proper collaboration tool Target Process 3 only during the sprint the software was not able to generate relevant burndown chart.
We at least tried to estimate how much time we spent working on each of the user stories listed in table \ref{tab:sprint0stories}.

\section{Architecture} \label{txt:sprint0architecture}

Considering the well established team collaboration model "forming, storming, norming and performing" the sprint 0 focused mainly on the first three parts.
Thus no architecture was needed and this task was assigned to the sprint 1.

\section{Implementation}

As explained in section \ref{txt:sprint0architecture} the sprint 0 was not aimed at the implementation and this task was assigned to the sprint 1.

\section{Testing}

Only the third party products were tested during the sprint 0. We focused on testing the online team collaboration tools including Trello, Gravity and TargetProcess3. The outcomes of our research are describer in chapter \ref{txt:development tools}.

\section{Occurring risks}

One of the more major risks we came across were the limitations of the selected collaboration tools used for controlling the Scrum process. As we were learning all the perks of using the Scrum methodology we continuously discovered that neither Trello nor Gravity software tools suited our needs and we had to spend more time searching for another tool and setting it up again. A few difficulties regarding the version control system Git preventing us from merging individual versions of the project plan document might be also considered as an risk which forced us to spend significant amount of time solving these issues.

\paragraph{Sprint goals:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Read compendium
    \item Find and agree suitable collaboration tools
    \item Start working the Project plan
    \item Fill backlog with stories
    \item Assign roles to members of the team
    \item Assign a name to our project
\end{itemize}
