\section{Sprint planning}
We have embraced Sprint 0 as a preliminary sprint, when we can set up all necessary collaboration tools, equipment, prepare templates for meetings and mainly to acquaint ourselves with Scrum methodology. The original plan was to finish sprint 0 on 8th of September, but we have decided to terminate it prematurely due to finishing sprint goals in shorter time than we had expected. Other reason for terminating the sprint was desire to start actually working on the product itself.

The actual user stories are listed in table \ref{tab:sprint0stories}. Since we started to use the software collaboration tool only during the sprint we did not manage to estimate the time needed to complete each story beforehand and thus the column \textbf{Est.} is left empty.

\section{System Burndown}
Since we managed to establish the proper collaboration tool Target Process 3 only during the sprint the software was not able to generate relevant burndown chart. We at least tried to estimate how much time we spent working on each of the user stories listed in table
