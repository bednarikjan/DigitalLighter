\section{Sprint planning}

The customer was very satisfied with the video for sprint 1, and suggested recording our future prototypes as well. 
After the successful sprint 1 review we started planning next sprint, sprint 2. Since the customer was very happy with our sprint 1 delivery, he gave us an oppourtunity to decide for ourselves what we wanted to work on this next sprint, and then ask for his approval. 
We decided to focus on multiple client support, and since sprint 1 just focused on connecting one client to the server, then we would also get the opportunity to refine the code we had implemented so far. The customer thought this was a really good idea, because working on this now could help us in future. Catching problems in early phases is much better then discovering them too close to the deadline. Then we might not get the needed time to fix it. Therefore Sprint 2 will focus on adding support for multiple clients connection and sending different signals to different clients. We should revise and improve our code so that we can move on to another core part, image processing, during the next sprint.

In the supervisor meeting the day after the sprint review, we showed our supervisor the project plan. 
We made a document that we called the project plan, but the supervisor wanted these sections to be integrated in the project report instead. Therefore we decided to put some report user stories for this sprint, so that we could integrate the project plan in the report. We also wanted to add the additional sections we needed, for example the sections from Sprint 1. 
Doing a report reasearch and getting a good content is imporant for this sprint, and getting up to speed with the sections.
