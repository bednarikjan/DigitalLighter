\section{General information}

The project is the making of the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project. 
Customer driven project is a course held at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, as mentioned briefly in the preface. 
This course accounts for 15 credits. 
It is a mandatory subject for the 4th year computer science students at IDI. 
The course aims to give the students a real experience with customers in a relevant IT-project. 
This course shall give the students a feel of managing a project in a group. 


All of the different groups is given one customer. 
The customer has put together a project, and to make sure the customer gets what he or she wants, there should be a close relationship with the customer.
Each group also receives an advisor, which will support and give advice to the group. 


The delivery of the course is a report and a product, and this will be presented to an examiner. 
The report is the most important part of the project, and will contain all the documentation for this project. The course will provide realistic experience in both report writing and product development driven by a customer. 
This will help the students perform better when they are out in real life employment situations.

\section {Terminology}
\section{Project and project name}

The customer wants a product to make the audience as a screen on a rock concert. We decided to name the product "digital lighter". We agreed on this name because this product digitalizes the concept from "the old days", where the crowd at a concert held up lighters, to create a special atmosphere. 

\section{Project purpose and concept}

The audience members at a rock concert should be able to download a simple application to their cell phone, and register this through a simple GUI.
Behind the artist on stage there is a screen, with a simple camera on top. 
The camera is taking pictures of the audience. 
At special occasions the audience will be instructed, by the artist, to hold up their phones with the screen towards the stage. 
The mobile is a replacement for the lighter.  

On control a signal the application will fill the entire mobile screen with a single color.
The control signal can as an example say: " all pixels white". 
The signal will be specific for each application.
Each mobile will be a pixel in a larger picture, which will be presented on the big screen. 
What kind of picture the audience can create will depend on the number of people in the audience.   

As a motivation for the audience to hold up their phone, the camera on top of the screen will take pictures of the audience.
In that way the audience can see a reflection of them selves, and see what kind of picture they are creating together.

\subsubsection{Customer contact}
Peder Kongelf will be our contact person in Netlight. We will have weekly meetings with him to make sure the project is going in the right direction, and of course get opportunities to ask questions. This way we will get a better understanding of the project.

\subsection{Development team}
 The development team's role is, first of all, to meet all requirements presented by the customer and IDI. We are responsible for development of the project. We are also responsible for writing all the documentation for this course.  Our interest in the project is to receive experience with new technologies and project management, as well as to receive satisfactory grading. The project was intended for 5-7 students,but we are only 4 members in our team. This will, in some way, affect what the team can manage towards what was expected when the project was put together.

\subsection{Supervisor}

Anh Nguyen Doc is the supervisor assigned to this project from The Department of Computer and Information Science,also called IDI. He is providing advice and guidance for the group throughout the project.

f course the interest from the university in general is to provide some real experience to the students, and prepare them for the business world.


\subsection{End users}
Is a everyday person who uses the end product. Our plan is to release the product on the application store for Android. That way we can get feedback from someone other than supervisor and customer. 
\subsection{Stakeholder summary}
