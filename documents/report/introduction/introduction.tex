\section{General information}
The project is the making of the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project. 
Customer Driven Project is a course held at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology accounted for 15 credits. 
%It is a mandatory course for the 4th year computer science students at IDI. 
The course aims to give the students a real experience with customers in a relevant IT project and shall give the students a feel of managing a project in a group.

All of the different groups are given one customer, who is person from real company. 
The customer has put together a project, and to make sure the customer gets what he or she wants, there should be a close relationship with the customer.
Each group also receives a supervisor, who will support, guide and give advice to the group. 

The delivery of the course is a report and a product, and this will be presented to an examiner. 
The report is the most important part of the project, and it contains all the documentation for this project. The course will provide realistic experience in both report writing and product development driven by a customer. 
This will help the students to perform better when they are in a real life employment situations.


\section{Project purpose and concept}
The audience members at a rock concert should be able to download a simple application to their smart phone, and register this through a simple GUI.
Behind the artist on stage there is a screen, with a simple camera on top. 
The camera is taking pictures of the audience. 
At special occasions the audience will be instructed, by the artist, to hold up their phones with the screen towards the stage. 
The mobile is a replacement for the lighter.  

On control a signal the application will fill the entire mobile screen with a single color.
The control signal can as an example say: all pixels white.
The signal will be specific for each application.
Each mobile's screen will be a pixel in a larger picture, which will be presented on the big screen. 
What kind of picture the audience can create will depend on the number of people in the audience. 

As a motivation for the audience to hold up their phone, the camera on top of the screen will take pictures of the audience.
In that way the audience can see a reflection of themselves, and see what kind of picture they are creating together.

\section{Project name}
The customer wants a product to make the audience as a screen on a rock concert. 
The team has decided to name the product \emph{Digital Lighter}. 
This name was settled because this product digitalizes the concept from "the old days", where the crowd at a concert held up lighters, to create a special atmosphere. 

\section{Goals}
Goals are statements that describe what the project will accomplish. 
The very first step in all projects is to define goals. 
It is important to spend sufficient time on this step, or else it can lead to unsuccessful project completion in many different ways. 
   
\label{sec:project-goals}

\subsection{Project goals}

\paragraph{Finish the project within the scheduled timetable}
One of the goals is to finish the project within the given time frame. 
In this particular case it means to deliver both product and report until 21th of November, when the final presentation take place.

\paragraph{Finish the project within the specified requirements}
Another goal is to make sure we are meeting the customer's needs.
This could be done simply by finishing the project with the specifics the customer really wanted. 
The best way to solidify this is to verify accomplishment by customer hand off and close down.

\subsection{Group goals}
\paragraph{Receive a good grade}
Getting a good grade is important because it says something about what you have learned in this course. 
This is relevant in terms of what job we might get when we have graduated. It also shows an employer that we can work hard. 
\paragraph{Receive a good recommendation from customer/supervisor}
If we work really hard, and impress the supervisor and the customer it would be nice to get a recommendation. This would be a bonus for our CV.


\subsection{Personal goals}
\paragraph{Agnethe}

My personal goal is to learn about group dynamics and collaboration. Another goal is learn more about writing reports, because it is important to get some experience before writing the masters report. One of my goals is also to  satisfy our customer, and maybe get a good recommendation. It is also a great chance that I might work as an IT-consultant, and I want to learn as much as possible about this profession. I also  get better at holding presentations, because there will always be another presentation to hold. I also want to learn as much as possible about android and mobile development.

\paragraph{Jan}

This class was suggested to me by a few students who have already passed it. As from what I have learned it should be challenging and the students should receive a lot of experience while working on a project. From this point of view my personal goal is to improve my soft-skills regarding team collaboration as well as the technical skills, mostly the Java/Android programming. While I study at the Computer graphics department on my home university the image processing part of this project is also of the great value for me. I also expect to get the proper feedback from both the supervisor and the customer so I could learn from the mistakes or wrong approaches.

\paragraph{Milos}

I had the opportunity to work on actual projects before, but never as a part of a team. 
My primary goal is to determine how to cooperate and work with others in achieving mutual goals.
I want to learn about agile software development in practice.
To find out how to separate tasks, how to manage an ongoing project, and how to be a valuable part of the team.
I didn't expect to gain any technical knowledge of this course, but after discovering the project assignment I definitely want to learn about image processing.
I expected multicultural team and that report has to be written in English.
Therefore I wanted to profound my knowledge of English Language.

\paragraph{Tomas}
I have chosen NTNU university for my exchange studies because of this class. 
I was expecting to improve my soft-skills, software engineering knowledge and also my written and spoken English and to be treated like in real project.
As this class has already started, I can add to my personal goals also learning Java programming language,
Android platform development and improving my skills concerning image processing.

\section{Stakeholders}

\section {Terminology}
\label{sec:terminology}
After a few meetings with the supervisor and customer, it was settled that we must present our terminology to prevent from misunderstandings since both customer and supervisor used different terminology.
Below there is listed product related terminology that will be used in further chapters of this report.

\paragraph{Client user}
is a participant of the concert who wants to actively take part in show and he can download client application.

\paragraph{Server user}
or simply \textbf{Manager} is a person who controls what media should be played on screen made from mobile phone's of users. 
He can also manage other general settings.

\paragraph{End user} is either manager or end client user.

\paragraph{DigitalLighter}
is the final product. It is containing of two separate applications \emph{client} and \emph{server}.


\paragraph{Client} or \textbf{Client side} is an application controlled by client user and provides him an opportunity to be part of the screen by displaying figures on his mobile.

\paragraph{Server} or \textbf{Server side} is and application controlled by manager and provides him opportunity to change the media displayed on screen.

\paragraph{Pixel} is a client user's mobile phone under control of the manager.
