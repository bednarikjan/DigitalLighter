In this chapter expected behavior of product and its resulting requirements will be described. 
First there will be introduced simple life cycle of the product.
Although project title was accepted as a domain and not a final product, following requirements could be applied also on project that is not scaled down.

\section{Description}
To clarify and properly explain life cycle of one run of server side application, its usage and possible requirements, structure of UML's activity diagram \cite{Dumas:2001:UAD:647245.719456} was adopted. 
Therefore we show in Figure \ref{fig:activity_diagram} interaction between manager and one client user.
Notice that there are some actions of both manager and client user which do require direct manipulation with mobile phone or other actors such as "Notice users to raise their mobiles", "Raise mobile", "Put down mobile" and more.

\end{figure}

\section{Requirements} \label{txt:requirements}
Requirements can be divided into two categories \cite[p.~19]{ntnu_req}: functional and non-functional. 
Functional ones describe a function which a system or system component must be able to perform \cite[p.~35]{ieee610.12:1990}.
On the other hand non-functional requirements cover what product is, they are any other requirements than functional  \cite[p.~20]{ntnu_req}.


\subsection{Functional}
The use case diagram of whole system with all actors is shown in Figure \ref{img:usecase}
According to this use case diagram, list of functional requirements was created.

	\item[\textbf{E1}] \label{req_E1}
		I as a end user want to be able to read instructions.
	\item[\textbf{E2}] \label{req_E2}
		I as a end user want to be able to download relevant application from mobile application store.

	\item[\textbf{C5}] \label{req_C5}

\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Manager} You can see list of functional requirements from manager's point of view below.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[\textbf{M1}] \label{req_M1}

	\item[\textbf{M2}] \label{req_M2}
		I as a manager I want to be able to create a server.
	\item[\textbf{M3}] \label{req_M3}
		I as a manager I want to be able view attendance.
	\item[\textbf{M4}] \label{req_M4}
		I as a manager I want to be able to start mobile phone localization.
	\item[\textbf{M5}] \label{req_M5}
		I as a manager I want to be able to choose playlist to be played.
	\item[\textbf{M6}] \label{req_M6}
		I as a manager I want to be able to start playing given media.
	\item[\textbf{M8}] \label{req_M7}
		I as a manager I want to be able to stop the media.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-functional}
You can see non-functional requirements listed below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textbf{N1}] \label{req_N1} Product must work as a server and client architecture.
\item[\textbf{N2}] \label{req_N2} Client side application must work on Android platform.
\item[\textbf{N3}] \label{req_N3} Application must be deployed to Google Play application store.
\item[\textbf{N4}] \label{req_N4} The product must be scalable -- it must work with  different count of mobile phones and it must support at least 16 client devices.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Quality attributes}
\phantomsection
\label{sec:quality_attributes}
Quality attributes are the overall factors that affect run-time behavior, system design, and user experience. They represent areas of concern that have the potential for application wide impact across layers and tiers. Some of these attributes are related to the overall system design, while others are specific to run time, design time, or user centric issues. The list and description of the quality attributes DigitalLighter application have to fulfill is below, and also shown on Figure \ref{img:qualityAttributes}.

\paragraph{Accessibility}
is the degree to which the product is available to as many people as possible. 
Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from the product. 
To achieve accessibility team plan to release the product on the Android Play Store\footnote{\url{https://play.google.com/store}} and thus enable everyone with Android device to try it. Use of TestFlight described in Section \ref{subsec:testflight} will allow easy access to application during implementation process for potential beta testers.

\paragraph{Interoperability}
describes the extent to which systems and devices can exchange data, and interpret that shared data. Digital Lighter server and client application should be able to mutually share specific structure or format of data that is preserved and unaltered during the process. For this purpose communication protocol will be established.

\paragraph{Maintainability}
is the ease with which a product can be maintained. This means the product needs to isolate defects or their cause, prevent unexpected breakdowns, correct defects and repair or replace faulty components. If one component need to be replaced, then the system should do this without having to replace still-working parts. The product also needs make future maintenance easy. 

\paragraph{Modifiability}
is all about handling changes, and this is including the extent to which this modification affects other functions. 
Code must be prepared for changes, and this can only be done by increase cohesion, and reduce coupling. 
If the modules get built smaller, the risk of having to make a change will be reduced. 
Team should also make sure that dependencies are restricted. 
Increasing the cohesion, or interdependency within modules, can affect build time, load time, initialization time or run time, therefore some trade-offs have to be done.

\paragraph{Performance}
is about managing system resources in the face of particular types of demands to achieve acceptable timing behavior.
Performance can be measured in terms of throughput and latency. 
Performance can be improved by reducing demand, or by managing resources more appropriately. 
Reducing demands will have the side effect of reducing fidelity, or refuse service to some requests. 
Managing the resources more fitting can be done through scheduling, relocation, or simply increase the resources available.
In particular performance objectives that have to be satisfied are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Client must be able to play command colors at least 1 frame per second,
\item Client need to have minimal possible impact on device's battery. 
\item Server must be able to recognize more than 80 \% of the present devices,
\item Server must detect one device in less than 2 seconds,
\item Server must be able to detect fake lights and cancel their influence on the system,
\item Server must be responsive and without User Interface freezing,
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Usability}
is the ease of use and learn about the product.
Usability includes methods of measuring usability, such as analysis of needs or the study of the principles behind an object's perceived efficiency or elegance. Digital Lighter have to be easy to use, understandable, and easy to learn. This can be achieved with good User Interface and logical sequence of actions in order to achieve desired behavior. Therefore team agreed on using only native widgets that all Android users are familiar with, making multiple Activities\footnote{\url{http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html}} composed of functionally related options, and providing only functionality given by requirements so visual noise can be reduced.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter it was explained how the application's basic life-cycle looks like and the use case diagram in Figure \ref{img:usecase} was introduced.
According to use case diagram there were created \emph{Epics} which serve as a requirements. 
After that non-functional requirements were introduced following by quality attributes that Digital Lighter have to satisfy.
These are summarized in Figure \ref{img:qualityAttributes}.
In following chapters each user story which is connected to relevant requirement will be referenced with requirement's identification.

As you could see, client user's interaction with both applications is rather simple (and as the customer suggested the user interface is not core of the work) the main attention will be focused on image processing, network programming, synchronization and mapping devices into screen.

User stories will be chosen by customer after discussion with team during each planning meeting.
Its priorities can be change anytime since the team is trying to be as agile as possible.
During the planning meeting, if needed, new stories can be created or some stories can be discarded.
