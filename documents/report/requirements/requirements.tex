\section{Description}
The product can be logically divided into two applications -- server side  and client side.
Each application will be used by different kind users and for better distinguishing of all terms we feel need to define them.

\section{Definitions}
In this section there will be defined and described actors in requirements to avoid misunderstandings. Since our customer namely specified the domain that we should focus on we named the actors as follows.

\paragraph{User} is a participant of concert who wants to actively take part in show and he can download client application.

\paragraph{Concert Manager} or simply \textbf{Manager} is a person who controls what media should be played on screen made from mobile phone's of users. 
He can also manage other general settings.

\paragraph{Client} or \textbf{Client side} is an application controlled by user and provides him opportunity to be part of the screen by displaying figures on his mobile.

\paragraph{Server} or \textbf{Server side} is and application controlled by manager and provides him opportunity to change the media displayed on screen.
