\section{Constraints}
We are developing this project under few technical resource, time and knowledge limitations.
Our biggest limitation is the image processing part.
Half of the team has no experience with this and the other half has little experience.
Their experience is mostly theoretical information about the subject and practical experience is preferred. 

We are aware of this limitation and our plan is to learn by doing.
We are going to start developing and teach ourself while coding.
We chose this approach because we do not want to spend more time than necessary doing research.
Another limitation is lack of experience with Mobile development within the
development team. All of the team members have Android phones, and to be
able to test our application, we have to develop an Android application. Only
one team member have experience with this.

If we are not scaling down the project then we do not have all necessary resources to test the system. As an example we do not have a huge audience.
Also we do not have access to a big screen etc. This is also a limitation.
As this course last for a 13 weeks, it is normal that we have to make some
trade-offs. This project is technically difficult, and there is a limited amount of
time.
