This chapter is devoted to describing the outcomes of the preliminary research focusing on the similar already existing projects and technologies we could utilize.

----\\
In this chapter preliminary studies will be presented, starting from current situation in the 
Cloud Systems. After that a WS-agreement will be presented and the explanation for the 
team choices will be given. \\

Since this is a prototype project, a
considerable time is put into this part of the project, to assure the team makes good choices when it

This chapter is ment to outline the preliminary study of our project. This includes what our technologies
aims to achieve and how we will use them to achieve this.

\section{Constraints}
We are developing this project under few technical resource, time and knowledge limitations.
Our biggest limitation is the image processing part.
Half of the team has no experience with this and the other half has little experience.
Their experience is mostly theoretical information about the subject and practical experience is preferred. 

We are aware of this limitation and our plan is to learn by doing.
We are going to start developing and teach ourself while coding.
We chose this approach because we do not want to spend more time than necessary doing research.
Another limitation is lack of experience with Mobile development within the
development team. All of the team members have Android phones, and to be
able to test our application, we have to develop an Android application. 
Only one team member have experience with this.

If we are not scaling down the project then we do not have all necessary resources to test the system.
As an example we do not have a huge audience or the access to a big screen used on concert stages.
As this course last for a 13 weeks, it is normal that we have to make some trade-offs.
This project is technically difficult and there is a limited amount of time.
