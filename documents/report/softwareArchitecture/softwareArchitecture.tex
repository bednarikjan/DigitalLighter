In this chapter, product architecture is described using 4 + 1 architectural view model.
It is based on the multiple concurrent views and therefore better explanation of architecture can be provided.

\section{4 + 1 view model}
\subsection{Logical view}
The description of the functional requirements of the architecture. The client and the server are decomposed into a set of key abstractions, taken(mostly) from the problem domain, in the form of objects or object classes.

\subsection{Development view}
\subsection{Process view}
\subsection{Physical view}
Physical view \cite{Kruchten:1995:VMA:624610.625529} describes the mapping of a software onto hardware. 
It takes into account non-functional requirements of the system.

Physical view is described in figure \ref{fig:architecture_deployment_diagram}.
According to requirement \refreq{N1}, there will be two executable files deployed; one deployed to client device and second to server device.
There is also need for NTP server, which will maintain all connected devices synchronized.
To generalize the architecture design, the \emph{camera} device is treated as a separate device, which will only send its output to server device.

\subsection{Scenarios}
Use case diagrams can be considered as scenarios, therefore introduced diagram \ref{img:usecase} in Requirements chapter can be considered as a scenario.
