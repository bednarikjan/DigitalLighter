\section{Stuff we wrote in the project plan}
Product can be logically divided into two sections -- client and server application.
Client side should be used by the audience whereas server side should be used by the concert manager.
Both kind of applications will communicate through network, there is no need of internet connection.

Each application can be divided into more detailed architecture; we will focus on that in next sprint.
