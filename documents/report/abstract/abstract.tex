This document gives an insight into the details of planning, preliminary research, requirements, design, actual implementation and evaluation of prototype product named \emph{Digital Lighter}.

The resulting application gives a rock concert audience an opportunity to take part in an active manner during a concert. 
All that is needed is a smart phone.
During the concert the audience is instructed to start the Digital Lighter application, connect to a server, and then raise their hands with the smart phone's screen toward to the stage. This is similar to holding up a lighter. 
Each screen then becomes a pixel on a giant screen, and a video can be played on it.

This is a proof of concept task covering all main problems of the domain.
