This document gives an insight into the details of planning, preliminary research, requirements, design, actual implementation and evaluation of prototype product named \emph{Digital Lighter}.

The resulting application gives rock concert audience an opportunity to take part during a concert in an active manner. 
All what is needed is a smart phone.
During the concert the audience is instructed to start a Digital Lighter application, connect to a server and raise their hands holding a smart phone's screen toward to the stage similar to holding up a lighter.
