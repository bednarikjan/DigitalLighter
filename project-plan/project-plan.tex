\section{Project scope}


\section{Project architecture}
Product can be logically divided into two sections -- client and server application.
Client side should be used by the audience whereas server side should be used by the concert manager.
Both kind of applications will communicate through network, there is no need of internet connection.

Each application can be divided into more detailed architecture; we will focus on that in next sprint.


\section{Measurement of Project Effects}
To measure success of our end-product we have to set up some criteria to be fulfilled. The product should pass all test-cases and function according to customer's requirements.

\section{Planned workload}
Compendium proposed week workload 25 person-hours per week. During our internal meeting we have decided that each member will spend 30 hours per week because our team consists only of 4 members. We agreed on fixed daily working hours so that we could distribute the workload through the whole semester. We will do daily stand-ups according to Scrum methodology.

\section{General Terms}
\subsection{Methology}

\subsection{Tools selections}
For Scrum support and issue tracking we use Gravity Tool\footnote{www.gravitydev.com}. 
The tool is right now in Beta but it is free to use and have all features we needed from proposed AgileZen.
For collaboration on Minutes, Project Plan and other documents we use GitHub. This tool was proposed by out customer and it is popular free collaboration tool.
For document editing we agreed on LaTeX.
For group resources and links we use Facebook groups and for managing shedule we use Google Calendar.
 
\subsection{Limitations}
We should develop this project under a few technical, resource, time and knowlage limitations. 
Big limitation is image processing and small expirience in Mobile development.
As this course last for a 13 weeks, it is normal that we had to make some trade-offs. We devoted 2 weeks in exploring technologies and possible similar solutions that we can benefit from.
